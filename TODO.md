# TODO

- Make the toolbars Melt-based (menu ?) so that the tabIndex is good and the focusTrap works

- make BaseObject other that a square compatible with the BufferedObject that is not the old Object format
- create simple 3d model to load and test them
- bring back the editor and the ability to place items on map
